# Create a Database

Up until now, we have defined the Models and Views in our databse. However, we do not yet have any data.

To add data, create a new database

You may create multiple databses. 

Please note that this data is for testing purposes only - so that you can create data that you cn use to help you build your application. When you run Budibase in production, your databses will be stored and accessed somewhere else
