# Create a Database

Up until now, we have defined the Models and Views in our database. However, we do not yet have any data.

To add data, create a new database:

You may create multiple databases. 

Please note that this data is for testing purposes only, so that you can create data that you can use to help you build your application. When you run Budibase in production, your databases will be stored and accessed somewhere else.
