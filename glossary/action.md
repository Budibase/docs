# Action

Actions are how you integrate custom backend code into your Budibase application. Actions are used to run behaviours. Actions have the following properties:

- Name. Should be unique, it is how your action is identified and called. In Budibase-web, your action will be callable via a url in the format `POST /api/actions/<action name>` . 
- Behaviour Source. The name of the javascript module that the behaviour resides in.
- Behaviour Name. The name of the behaviour to run
- Initial Options. A default argument for the behaviour. The caller of the action can supply partially completed argument, which will be completed by these Initial Options.
