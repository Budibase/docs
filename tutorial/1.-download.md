Welcome to Budibase! We’re glad you’re here. The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through building and deploying your first Budibase web app from scratch. As we walk through that process, we’ll introduce some more general web development topics, and go over the underlying structure of a Budibase web application.

Within this tutorial, we will build a simple CRM and cover the 4 fundamentals of Budibase:

1. [Adding data](3.-add-data.md)
2. [Designing and building our interface](4.-design.md)
3. [Automating processes](5.-automate.md)
4. [Deploying our web application](6.-deploy.md)
