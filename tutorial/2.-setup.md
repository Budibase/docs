  Setting up your first web application is pretty straight forward and only
  takes a few seconds.
---

# 1. Setup

1. To begin, click the create new app button. 
2. You will now see a modal. Give your new web app a new name. We're going to call ours: `Simple CRM`
3. Add your web app's first user. Our  user will be called: `Budi Sales` _Budibase comes with authentification out of the box, which is why must add a user at this stage - if we didn't, we wouldn't be able to log in._

And that's setup complete. You are ready to move to the next stage of the tutorial.
