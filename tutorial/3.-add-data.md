# 2. Add data

Budibase's data section is often described as the backend of your web app. This where you add and manage your data. Budibase apps rely on data and it is strongly advised to create your data structure before designing your web application. 

At the highest level, we have `Tables`. Tables are collections of information, organized in `Columns` and `Rows`. Each row has information, which is organised by columns. Just like a spreadsheet.

Creating a data structure is similar to adding data to a spreadsheet. You begin by adding your columns. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A column is also known as a field, and a row is also known as a record.
{% endhint %}
