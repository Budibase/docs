# 2. Getting started with Budibase and creating your first app

* [ ] Open Budibase
* [ ] Add your API key \(you can find this in the hosting portal\)
* [ ] Give your web app a name - Simple CRM
* [ ] Add your first user - we will call ours Budi Sales. Budibase comes with authentification out of the box, which is why must add a user at this stage - if we didn't, we wouldn't be able to log in.
* [ ] Click Submit - and voila, thatâ€™s setup complete.
