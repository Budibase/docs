# 2. Add data

Budibase's data section is often described as the backend of your web app. This is where you add and manage your data. Budibase apps rely on data and it is strongly advised you create your data structure before designing your web application. 

At the highest level, we have `Tables`. Tables are collections of information, organized in `Columns` and `Rows`. Each row has information, which is organised by columns. Just like a spreadsheet.

{% hint style="info" %}
A column is also known as a field, and a row is also known as a record.
{% endhint %}

For Simple CRM, we will only require one table. Click the **create table** button within Budibase, and name it:

`Deals`

A table should now appear. Our table is looking pretty empty, so let's add columns. Click the **add new column** button. 

When creating a column, we must decide on its type and name. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Column types, also known as field types, stipulate what sort of data should go into each column. To find out more about column types, [visit columns](../data/tables/columns.md).
{% endhint %}
