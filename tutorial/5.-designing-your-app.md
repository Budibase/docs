  Designing web apps in Budibase is super-fun. Budibase is flexible and you can
  design just about anything. To make life easier and speed up development we
  have provided a few automations along the way.

# 5. Designing your app



Budibase's Design interface has 3 sections:

1. The left panel contains your navigation settings, 
2. The middle section contains your components and a preview of your web app, 
3. And the right panel contains your settings and design properties.

At the highest level, you have two sides to your new web app; private and public. We’ll take a quick look at the public side first.

## Public App

The public side of your web app is what anyone on the internet can access. Currently, it is only possible to have a login page here. You can easily change the logo, text, and look and feel of this page using the settings and design properties available in your right panel.

* [ ] We will change our logo by simply replacing the logo URL with the one below: https://i.imgur.com/3SvFo1k.png

What’s really cool is Budibase takes care of authentication for you, saving you hours of development and allowing you to focus on building the private section of your web app.
