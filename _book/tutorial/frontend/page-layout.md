# Page Layout

Every Budibase "Page" \(which we will cover later\), will have a "Page Layout".

A Page Layout is what defines the basic structure of a page. It remains even as the page's inner content is changed.

A common example of layout would be a page with a Navigation bar header, and content underneath... like GitHub:

![page-layout-example-github](../../.gitbook/assets/page-layout-example-github.png)

Back to the Budibase builder, click on "Page Layout" to start designing:
