# How comfortable am I with writing code ?

![required skill level](./skill-level.jpg)

We have been surveying our signups, asking the question:

> How comfortable are you with writing code ? **1**=Not Comfortable at all .... **5**=Very Comfortable

**Eventually**, we want Budibase to be able to serve people who answered 2,3,4 and 5. 

**We are starting** with the 4s and 5s.

How we would describe these levels....

## Levels 4 & 5 could be ...

Someone with real world software development experience

Someone who has completed a programming educational course. A degree, bootcamp, self taught course 

Someone who has contributed code to open source.

## Levels 2 & 3 could be ...

A web designer, who knows their way around HTML and CSS, but is not too confident with JavaScript

A systems administrator, who sometimes has to understand/piece together a shell script

A business IT person who loves to hack away with spreadsheet formulas

Basically anyone who has a a little coding exposure, but is not afraid to learn
