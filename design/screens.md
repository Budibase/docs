# Screens

Your application is made up of Screens. There are two types of Screens within Budibase; Master and Normal.

### Master screen

The master screen is where you place items which are consistent throughout your applications i.e. your navigation. The master screen is similar to the 'master slide' in Powerpoint. By placing these items within the master screen, you tell the browser it does not have to reload this component every time the user clicks on a new screen. This makes your app feel incredibly quick and smooth.   
  
**Screen Slot**

Within the master screen, you will notice a component called Screen Slot. The Screen Slot is where your normal screens are positioned within your application.

### Normal screen

The normal screens _slot_ into your screen slot when the application is compiled. It if it easier, you can think of normal screens as pages. Normal screens will include  home, account, settings, etc.
