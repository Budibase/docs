# Introduction to Design

Budibase's Design section is often described as the frontend builder within Budibase. This is where you create and build your user interface. 

### Single Page Applications

The web apps produced by Budibase are single page applications. Also know as SPAs, these are a highly performant type of app. The reason they perform so well, is because SPAs only send the required information to the browser. This makes the applications produced by Budibase, feel quick and smooth.

Budibase apps rely on data and it is strongly advised to create your data structure before designing your web application.
