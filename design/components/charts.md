# Chart

Use the Chart component to display data from your tables to your users in a visually pleasing manner. The chart components pull in two types of values from your Tables; an X value and a Y value. The data within the column linked to the Y-axis must be a ['Number' \(data type](../../data/tables/columns.md)\).
