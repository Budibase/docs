# Icon

This component is using the fantastic [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) icon font, a project by Dave Gandy. Altogether Font Awesome provides more than 1500 symbols and glyphs for web-related actions. These icons are great, because they enable you to easily change color, size, and more via the Design panel. They are scalable vector graphics, which means that they look great on high-resolution displays.
