# States

States, also known as pseudo-classes, let you apply a style to a component when it's in a special state i.e. when a user is hovering over a button.

## Support States:

### **Active**

The **`:active`** state represents an component \(such as a button\) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the mouse button.

### **Hover**

The **`:hover`** state matches when the user interacts with a component, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor.

## How to activate a state \(example involves the Hover state\)

* [ ] Add component \(only certain components accept transitions: links, text, buttons, containers\).
* [ ] Navigate to your Transition design properties
* [ ] Select your property - 'All' is usually a safe bet
* [ ] Set your duration 
* [ ] Setting your easing
* [ ] **Navigate to one of the hover state**
* [ ] Design your components 2nd state
