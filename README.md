# Introduction



### Get Started

There are two main ways to get started with Budibase:

1. Tutorial: Step-by-step instructions on how to install Budibase and start a new project: written for developers with no Budibase experience. Many non-developers/citizen developers have also successfully completed the tutorial.
2. [Quick start](user-guide/quick-start.md): For the speedsters out there who like to jump right in, we have a one-page quick start guide for you: written for more experience developers.
