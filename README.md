# Introduction to Budibase

Budibase is an [open source](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase), low-code platform, for creating full stack web applications.

## Why?

Developing applications takes time. Time is our most valuable asset. 

A large percentage of effort that goes into creating any web application today is spent on tasks that are shared between all other applications that you have ever made.

For example..

- Creating your data model
- Making HTTP endpoints to read and write these datamodels
- Writing validation rules, for your data and duplicating them on the front and backend.
- Creating and hooking up a "nav"
- Laying out forms, and hooking up button clicks to POST endpoints.
- Creating access levels, and applying them to the front and backend
- Managing your application's instances (customers), and their users, in production.

The list goes on.

We want to get you past these common features within hours. Then, (if you need to) you should be able to write code (front and backend), to develop the parts of your application that make your application unique - the exciting parts of development.

With the Budibase builder, you can use a GUI (the "Budibase Builder") to build out the basics of your backend. Then, using a combination of the builder and component libraries, application themes and templates, you build out your frontend. 

You may then customise your backend using Nodejs, and your frontend using your favourite JavaScript and CSS frameworks.
