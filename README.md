# 👋 Budibase Documentation

## Get Started

There are two main ways to get started with Budibase:

1. 📘 [**Tutorial &gt;**](tutorial/1.-download.md)  Step-by-step instructions on how to download Budibase, start a new project, and build a simple web application. The tutorial aims to be easy to follow and comprehensive. It is a great starting point for users who are new to no-code and do not have Budibase experience. 
2. 🌠 [**Quick start &gt;**](quick-start/quick-start.md) ****  For the speedsters out there who like to jump right in, we have a one-page quick start guide for you: written for more experienced users.
