The Pie and Donut Charts are both circular charts. They're great in visualizing percentages, like how much of a pie you're going to get. 

They both behave and look the same, with the exception of the shape. The Donut Chart has a hole in the middle, where the Pie chart does not.

## Adding a Pie or Donut Chart

To add a Pie or Donut chart, head over to the design section in the Budibase UI. Then, you'll need a wrapping [Data Provider](doc:data-provider). After you've added the data provider, add a `Chart > Pie Chart` or `Chart > Donut Chart` to the design as a child of the data provider. This should connect your chart to the database directly.

Then, in the <Glossary>Settings Panel</Glossary>, you will want to configure how to display the data. This kind of chart is probably often filled with data coming from a [View](doc:views), but can of course be connected directly to a table as well.

First, in the `Label column` setting, you want to select which column represents the label of the data you want to display, then in the `Data column` you want to select the column which represents data in a [Number](doc:number) format to display in the chart. Once this is done, your chart should already be ready to view!

For more customization, check the reference table below.

## Settings panel

The settings panel has quite a few customization options, allowing you to get the most out of your pie or donut chart.
