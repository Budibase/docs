In Budibase, Agents enable AI to interact with the data, tools, and automations in your Workspace.

In this guide, we’ll build a simple AI Service Desk Agent that can:

* Answer questions about tickets
* Categorise and summarise new tickets
* Update ticket statuses
* Escalate urgent issues automatically

Along the way, we’ll learn how to:

* Configure an Agent’s instructions
* Connect Workspace data as tools
* Define structured outputs
* Trigger automations from Agent actions
* Test and iterate safely

Let’s jump in.
