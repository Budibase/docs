## Navigate To

Use this action if you want to go to another web page or app screen.\
For example: [Navigation on row button click](doc:url-parameters)

When the *Destination* is set to 'URL', you have the option to open the link in a new tab.

Alternatively, if the *Destination* is set to 'Screen', then you can select a screen to navigate to from the dropdown. The screen can optionally be opened in the current tab, or in a [modal](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/screens#modal-screen).

You can learn more about using URL parameters with the `Navigate To` action [here](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/url-parameters).

## Trigger Automations

Often there are times where you would like to trigger a automation after a user has performed an action. There are a range of different [Automations](doc:custom-automations). You are able reference any created automations by clicking the `Use an existing automation` radio button and then selecting an existing previously created automations to use and run.

Lastly, creating fields within the automation itself allows data/bindings to be sent to it, this can then be used in your automation to perform whatever task you require. An example of this would be passing an `_id` of a row to the automation to then update the row's state e.g. from `Pending` to `In progress`.

## Logout

If you want to log a user out, you can use this action. It has redirect functionality built in meaning you can redirect to whatever url you desire.

## Close Screen Modal

If the current screen has been opened as a [Modal](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/screens#modal-screen), then close it. Additionally, you can navigate to a new screen or open a different screen modal afterwords also using this action.

## Close Modal

This action takes no settings, and will close any modal component open on screen.

## Open Modal

Opens a modal component on a screen - different to a "Navigate to" action with "Open screen in modal", which opens an entire screen in a modal, this action opens a modal component that is already on the current screen. See [modal component]()

## Show Notification

This allows you to show a popup notification, of which there are four different types; `Success`, `Warning`, `Error` and `Info`. Changing the type will change the styling of the popup for example: success will be have a green background where as error will have a red background. Additionally you can make use of the bindings to output more informative messages. E.g. `Hi {{ Current User.email }} welcome to Budibase.`

### Logic within notifications

It is possible to use some logic with the notification - if the result of the logic running is falsy, no message will show. This can be used in conjunction with a "Continue if/Stop If" step to show the user some feedback explaining why the action has stopped.

## Prompt User

This action adds an additional step before other actions are run. The title, message, and button text can all be customised. It provides a prompt to the user, and won't run any other action after it unless they click the confirm button. This is very useful for a longer chain of actions, as it provides context and gives the option to cancel the process before it starts
