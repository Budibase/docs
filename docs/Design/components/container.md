The container now has two different layouts. You can toggle between these two modes by switching between the icons of the layout setting. By default, the grid-based layout is selected. If you wish to use the old layout, you must click the first displayed icon.

## Grid-based

This layout allows users to drag, resize, and place their components anywhere on the screen. It also allows you to resize components based on the view mode you have currently selected in the builder. This allows you to build [responsive screens](doc:designing-for-mobile) easily for mobile and tablet devices.

To drag, hover over the component and click on its label. This will allow you to drag the component freely within the builder's design area. If you don't click on the label, you will just be able to resize the component.

## Flexbox

A Container is a `div` with pre-defined styles. They are the building blocks of your application and critical for responsive design. Containers are used to structure your application and layout other components/elements in a structured way. You can use [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) to layout the items within your container.

## Container settings

### Flexbox

There are several general settings for the container component, most of which are shared with other components as well.

### Container background colour

You can also splash some color into your apps with containers!

To clear the selected color, click on the `X` in the bottom right of the panel. 

For additional flare, there are a range of gradients available.

| Title            | Gradient                                                                            |

## Component layout

When using containers to layout your components, the most important setting is _Direction_ as this will determine the flow of components.

        null,
        "Screen column layout"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Container column layout"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/32ffd44b23c9d4964031606dfd4818f3871922b3a9a77b45f54672fc9e759336-Screenshot_2024-09-12_at_12.35.50.png",
        null,

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Container row layout"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If you need additional layout you can add additional containers. For example what if we wanted to group 'THREE' and 'FOUR' in column direction, but have an overall row layout for the screen. In this case we need to add a container and nest P3 and P4 like so:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a1c8a0e071fab3bf20021674399edfaae2a66b11f27c2201783ac11f2508ac7d-Screenshot_2024-09-12_at_12.38.14.png",
        null,
        "Combining row and column directions"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Multi-container row column directions"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


Containers are a really flexible way to arrange your components in the **Design** section. You can nest any number of containers with different styles and layout options.

You may, however be interested in [Using sections](doc:using-sections) or [Field groups](doc:field-groups) to get out-of-the-box layouts.
