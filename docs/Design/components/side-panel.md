A side panel is a special container that slides in from the right-hand side when opened. 

You have a wide variety of different components that can be added to the side panel. There are a few that aren't allowed to be nested inside. Another side panel, modal and a section.

### Opening a side panel

Side panels are opened via the **Open Side Panel** [Action](doc:actions). This could be triggered from a button click, or some other event such as on change.

You can choose to open any side panel that is anywhere in the screen component tree.

### Closing a side panel

A side panel can be closed by a user simply clicking an area outside of the panel, or by clicking the close arrow.

Alternatively, the **Close Side Panel** action can be used.

No screen needs to be selected as this action will automatically close any currently open side panel. 

## Side panel settings

The side panel component itself has some settings.

* **Ignore outside clicks**—when checked, this prevents the side panel from closing unless a button action is clicked or the closing action shown above is clicked.
* **On Close** - This setting allows you to run actions when the side panel is closed. For example, you could run an action that refreshes a data provider or update a state value etc.

> 👍 Table block
>
> The [Table block](doc:table-block) supports built-in side panels for quickly viewing row detail or creating new entries.

### App state & Side panel

When using the side panel you may want to create/update [App state](doc:app-state) for use by a component nested within. An example of this would be; the [Form](doc:form) / [Form Block](doc:form-block) components, app state can be passed into these. The aim of this is to prevent users from jumping between pages and providing a more enriched interactive experience.

Additionally you can use the side panel as an area which contains additional information of the selected item.

#### Example

**Form usage**

1. Add the table component with a related data provider (for this I will be using the inbuilt test data).
2. Add the side panel component.
3. Within the table component `ON ROW CLICK` add 2 different actions: `Update state` and `Open side panel`\

4. Add a key name, I've used selectedRow and updated the value with `{{ Clicked row._id }}`.\

5. Add a [Form](doc:form) / [Form Block](doc:form-block) for this example I will be using the [Form Block](doc:form-block)
6. Change the form to update/read only, then add the selectedRow app state to the `Row ID`

A similar approach to the above can be done for simply displaying additional information.

Follow the previous steps until `Step 5`. (Please ensure the side panel along with the newly created data provider are nested within the parent data provider.) From here we are going to add a [Data provider](doc:data-provider) and nested within that a [Repeater](doc:repeater). From here click on your newly created [Data provider](doc:data-provider), then click `Define Filters`

Add a filter which uses the parent [Data provider](doc:data-provider) (limits the outgoing requests). Start building out your side panel area to include additional content you wish to show on click.
