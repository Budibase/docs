The `Stat Card` component is a really simple UI element to quickly display a number from a database, calculated or hardcoded in a card format, allowing you do display some quick data.

All three label properties (Title, Value, Label) support [Bindings](doc:bindings) through Handlebars or JavaScript functions. In the example above you can see this demonstrated in a mixture of ways, there's a calculation happening on an average latitude, there's a number of rows displayed from the database, and there's the current user's `firstname` displayed as the title. 

## Adding a Stat Card

The Stat Card is located under `Card > Stat Card` in the Budibase design section. A wrapping [Data Provider](doc:data-provider) is not required as the Stat Card can also display information about the user, or run JavaScript functions. However, if you want to display data from <<glossary:Data Sources>> you'll need to add the Stat Card as a child of a [Data Provider](doc:data-provider) that has the Data Source connected.

## Displaying Data

If you want to display data in a Stat Card, you can use [Bindings](doc:bindings) in the <<glossary:Settings Panel>>. There are three values you can set using Bindings.

| Setting | Description                                                          |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title   | The top-most text on the card                                        |
| Value   | The middle text in blue, which is also the biggest text on the card. |
| Label   | The descriptor on the bottom of the card, which is the smallest      |
