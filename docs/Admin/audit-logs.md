## Viewing Audit logs

![](https://files.readme.io/ccbbebc-image.png)

After navigating to the Audit logs section, you are presented with the above table, where you can monitor, filter and view more details about each of your logs. 

You can see here that all of these logs are associated with the `Car Rental Admin Panel` application, however, some logs like `User created` will have no application attached to them. 

You can also drill down to see more information and metadata ona particular log by clicking on the `Details`button. This will expand a side panel like the image below.

You can see numerous pieces of metadata including the IP address, User Agent as well Application and User IDs. Each event type will have different metadata and properties associated with it. 

## Filtering Audit logs

As shown in the above image, there are a number of different ways to filter your audit logs. 

### 📘 Filter types

#### User

Filter by a single or multiple users. Use the search box within the dropdown to search through all users on the system

#### App

Filter by a single or multiple apps. All apps available on the system will be displayed in the dropdown and can be searched

#### Event

Filter by single or multiple events. 

#### Date Range

You can filter by any date range. The default is set to 30 days, but any range is permissible. Selecting one date will display all results from then until the current date. 

#### Search

The search input allows a full text search on all of the properties within an audit log. For example, you could search for an App ID such as `app_dev_uuid1` and any audit logs that have that as a value within any property will be returned.

Any combination of these filters will work, and the filters will be applied in the order they are applied. 

## Downloading your audit logs
