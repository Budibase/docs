The Single User and Multi User column types allow you to select a Budibase user from a dropdown list as determined by the [Application access](doc:application-access).  This list will include all admins of the tenant, and any members of the app.

      "caption": "Note the slight variation in icons between Single User (team_leader) and Multi User (team_members) columns"
    }
  ]
}

With the user column added, you can now click the `+` within your data grid view to select a user as identified by their searchable email address. When using a Single User column, if you try to add another user, the current user will be removed.

## Usage

A common usage of user columns in your tables is to indicate _ownership_ or _assignment_. 

For example, I can add an 'Assignee' user column to a 'Jobs' table to indicate who is responsible for completing that job. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/30a33d7-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_13.03.13.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


When making use of a user column in your [Forms](doc:forms), you need to use the [User Field](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/pickers#user-field) component.

<br />

### Show current user records

For single user columns, you can [filter](doc:searchfilter-data) on the currently logged in user by using the `{{ Current User._id }}` [binding](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/users-table#current-user-bindings).

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/96e4eaf-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_16.00.31.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If your user column has _Allow multiple users_ enabled, then the filter will be a [contains](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/multi-select#filtering) like so:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c4b0dec-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_16.05.54.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

## Migrate to user column

> 📘 
> 
> As of **v2.11.0** you will no longer be able to create a relationship between the [Users table](doc:users-table) and a <<glossary:Budibase DB>>.
> 
> To accommodate this change, apps that were created before **v2.11.0** can migrate existing user table relationship fields to the new user column, as outlined below.

1. Open your existing app and navigate to the Budibase table that contains a user relationship
2. Click the hamburger menu, and select the last option: `Migrate to user column`

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c19c5d3-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_16.28.38.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Click `Continue` to create the new user column. As warned, you may need to update some existing bindings

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/10b98fa-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_16.30.18.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/7346683-Screenshot_2023-11-03_at_16.31.17.png",
        "",
        "User column added"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "User column added"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


This will remove the link from the **App users** table and can improve the performance of your apps.

It should also be noted that if you were [displaying user data](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/fetching-data#display-user-specific-data) through a migrated relationship link, this would also need to be updated as shown in the 'Usage' section above.
