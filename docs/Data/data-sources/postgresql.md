# Tutorial: Inventory management

In this tutorial we will look at using the [DVD Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) within Budibase. A link to **pgadmin** import instructions are included in that article, but it is worth noting that if you are not on Windows, you will want to extract the zip folder, and restore from _Directory_ instead.

![](https://files.readme.io/0c9bb3a-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_15.39.23.png)

This sample database includes a complete system of film details through to payments and customer details. To keep the tutorial to a modest size, we shall focus on the film details and inventory management.

<br />

## Datasource setup

Assuming you have setup the example database on a running Postgres instance, we can start pulling data into Budibase. 

First create an app - no sample data needed.

![](https://files.readme.io/c2a0ca2-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_15.47.10.png)

Click `Add source`, select `PostgreSQL` and press `Continue`. 

![](https://files.readme.io/f70dc3d-1_postgres.png)

You will then be presented with a connection configuration modal. Fill in the correct connection details but press **Skip table fetch**. We want to manually fetch tables later so we can choose the tables we want to use in our Budibase app. 

> 📘 
> 
> Note that if you are connecting to a database on `localhost`, your host should be set to `host.docker.internal`, or `172.17.0.1` if running on Linux.

![](https://files.readme.io/3227724-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_16.09.03.png)

Now we have the Postgres <<glossary:Datasource>> added, and the configuration page should be displayed. 

Under the **Tables** section press `Fetch tables`. Tick `Fetch listed tables only` and provide the following table names:

```
category
film_category
film
language
film_actor
inventory
actor
store
address
city
country
```

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8fd4eef-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_16.16.42.png",
        null,
        "Fetch the listed tables"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Fetch the listed tables"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

<br />

## Defining relationships

With our tables fetched, we can now define relationships within Budibase. 

We will need to setup the relationships as presented in the [DVD Rental ER Model](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/), excluding the tables we did not fetch.

Click the `Define relationship` button below the **Table** section.

Setup a _Many->Many_ relationship between the **category** and **film** tables. Notice the error received below:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/73692ad-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_16.30.52.png",
        null,
        "film_category is not a valid Budibase join table"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "film_category is not a valid Budibase join table"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

This error is caused by the _Not NULL_ constraint on the **last_update** column. This is easily resolved by setting this column to _nullable_ in **pgadmin**. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a139ff6-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_16.34.22.png",
        null,
        "Setting last_update to nullable"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Setting last_update to nullable"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

**Do the same for the _last_update_ column in the _film_actor_ table.**

In addition, the **inventory** table is a through table that will need adjusted like so:

![](https://files.readme.io/9d0ebd6-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_10.25.43.png)

> 📘 
> 
> Make sure to re-fetch the tables to pull down the new schema information!

You should now be able to create this _Many->Many_ relationship. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/6718461-Screenshot_2023-02-07_at_16.39.00.png",
        null,
        "Many to Many relationship between category and film"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Many to Many relationship between category and film"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

When all relationships have been defined, you should see something like so:

![](https://files.readme.io/cd9e620-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_10.26.55.png)

<br />

## Stores screen

Add an [autogenerated screen](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/screens#autogenerated-screen) for the **store** table. Change the _Title_ to 'Stores'. 

Next `Configure columns`, click `Add all columns`, and then remove columns with the `x` so that only the address is displayed. 

### Adding a flag icon

We will also add a flag image within the table to indicate the country of the store. It would be possible to write insert statements to add image URLs for the two stores, but for the sake of demonstration we will use the country name from the **store address** relationship.

[Eject](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/blocks#ejecting-blocks) the table block. As there are only two stores, uncheck the pagination of the Data provider. 

#### Naive approach: using multiple repeaters

Select the [Table](doc:table) and click `Add component` to nest a [Repeater block](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/blocks#repeater-block). Select the address relationship as the datasource.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e1dd99e-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_10.53.17.png",
        null,
        "Using the address relationship as a datasource"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Using the address relationship as a datasource"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

We then have to nest another repeater block under the first one to hop from the **city** table to the **country** table!

Select the city relationship as the datasource.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ad8eb62-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_11.29.31.png",
        null,
        "City relationship of the address table"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "City relationship of the address table"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

Finally we can nest an [Image](doc:image) component within the City repeater block. Provide the following [JavaScript](doc:javascript) binding:

```javascript
const countryName = $("City Repeater block.city.country")[0].primaryDisplay.toLowerCase();

return `https://images.mapsofworld.com/${countryName}/${countryName}-flag.gif`;
```

The _primaryDisplay_ property works here because the country name is the [table display column](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/budibasedb#selecting-the-display-column).

![](https://files.readme.io/23377d6-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_11.36.21.png)

#### Better approach: using a custom query

Adding two nested repeater blocks is not ideal for performance, and is also not very maintainable. Considering that we are looking to get specific data from the relationships, using [custom SQL queries](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/sql-datasource#add-query) is better for this scenario.

In the **Data** section add a query to your PostgreSQL datasource. Give it the name 'Get Country Names', give it a <<glossary:Binding>> or the **address_id** with the query:

```sql
SELECT LOWER(country) as country_name FROM address a
JOIN city on a.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN country c ON c.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE a.address_id = {{ address_id }}
```

![](https://files.readme.io/941232a-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.23.28.png)

Make sure to click `Run Query` followed by `Save Query`!

Now back to the **Design** section, the two existing repeater blocks can be replaced with a single new repeater block, using our new query as the datasource. Click the cog icon to open the binding drawer. Assign the **address_id**.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2d852cc-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.20.15.png",
        null,
        "Image repeater block"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Image repeater block"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

![](https://files.readme.io/04bb90e-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.24.13.png)

Finally the image URL can be set to the following Handlebars expression: 

```
https://images.mapsofworld.com/{{ Image Repeater block.Get Country Names.country_name }}/{{ Image Repeater block.Get Country Names.country_name }}-flag.gif
```

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c9cebc1-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.26.19.png",
        null,
        "Custom query reduces the number of repeater blocks needed"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Custom query reduces the number of repeater blocks needed"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

### Adding a store map location

First we need to make a [REST API](doc:rest) call to get the longitude/latitude from our address. Go to the **Data** section, and add a REST datasource.

I used the [OpenCage API](https://opencagedata.com/api), which you can sign up to and receive an API key to use.

Select the `GET` method and paste in the URL: 

```
https://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json
```

Add a binding called 'location' and give it a default value. Next add two params. One for your API **key**, and another for the **q** (query string). Click the lightning bolt icon to select the _location_ binding.

![](https://files.readme.io/5eb3911-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.51.51.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/4acac32-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.53.23.png)

| <img src="https://files.readme.io/5a240d0-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.56.59.png" /> | <img src="https://files.readme.io/4d8783b-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_12.55.54.png" /> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

To make sure we're pulling the co-ordinates of the first result, add the following to your [Transformer](doc:transformers):

```javascript Transformer
return data.results[0]?.geometry
```

After clicking the `Send` button, your <<glossary:Schema>> should include the latitude and longitude. Make sure to also click the `Save` button!

![](https://files.readme.io/f049f53-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_13.24.05.png)

We will need to pull the **city** name and **country** name for a given **address_id** in order to make use of this API. As before, a custom SQL query is the most efficient way to do this. In fact we can update our existing _Get Country Name_ query without breaking the current usage for the flag image.

Click on the _Get Country Names_ query under the PostgreSQL datasource. Update the query to pull back the city name as follows:

```sql
SELECT LOWER(country) as country_name, city FROM address a
JOIN city on a.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN country c ON c.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE a.address_id = {{ address_id }}
```

The schema should now have two fields: one for the country, and one for the city. Make sure to run and save the query.

![](https://files.readme.io/7194b73-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_13.36.17.png)

With the REST query set up, go back to the **Design** section. Within the _Details side panel_, eject the _Details form block_. This will give us access to the **store** entry data. Click on the Repeater and add a repeater block with the name 'Location Repeater Block', which will be nested below. Set the _Get Country Names_ as the datasource, and click the cog icon to pass in the binding `{{ Repeater.store.address_id }}`. Drag the Form into the new _Location Repeater Block_. 

Currently the heading is displaying the ID value of the store. This isn't very nice, so let's replace it with the store location. Replace the [Heading](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/displaying-text#headline) _Text_ handlebars with the following: 

```
{{ Location Repeater block.Get Country Names.city }}
```

You can use the bindings helper on the left hand panel to insert this value. It is also unlikely that you would want _\_id_ fields in the form, so go ahead and delete those.

Next nest a [Data provider](doc:data-provider) under the Location repeater block, below the form. Set the datasource to REST query we added earlier, and click the cog icon to pass in the following binding for the query string param:

```
{{ Location Repeater block.Get Country Names.city }}, {{ Location Repeater block.Get Country Names.country_name }}
```

Finally nest an [Embedded Map](doc:map) underneath the REST query data provider. Choose it as the _Provider_ and select the _lat_ and _lng_ keys.

![](https://files.readme.io/920e662-Screenshot_2023-02-08_at_14.12.18.png)

<br />

## Viewing available films in store

Create a new screen with the route: `/film/:storeid`.

Add a [Row Explorer block](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/blocks#row-explorer-block) for the **film** table. Set the _Height_ to `800px` and set the _Search Field_ to `title`. Assign the _Title_, _Subtitle_, and _Description_ to some appropriate bindings, e.g.

- `{{ Film Explorer Block.film.title }}`
- `{{ Film Explorer Block.film.release_year }}`
- `{{ Film Explorer Block.film.description }}`

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ab8a72b-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_13.40.36.png",
        null,
        "Selecting the film description from the binding dropdown"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Selecting the film description from the binding dropdown"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

As we want to filter the list of films by the _store_id_ that we [pass via the URL](doc:url-parameters) go ahead and eject the Row Explorer block, and `Define filters` for the now exposed Data provider.

Click `Add filter` to add an additional filter for the _store_id_ column. 

![](https://files.readme.io/5c86a2d-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_13.48.13.png)

Back to the `/store` screen, click on the table and add a new [Link](doc:link) component. Give it the name 'View films' and the URL binding: `/film/{{ Table.store.store_id }}`.

![](https://files.readme.io/f64dd4f-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_14.09.00.png)

### Adding the film rating image

At the moment the row explorer presents the film information in a basic form. This is fine, but let's make it look a little nicer. 

First remove the **rating** field, and any of the fields that you do not wish to be displayed or edited from the [Form block](doc:form-block). Next eject the form block so that the data provider can be used.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/db4d3f4-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_14.20.14.png",
        null,
        "Selecting the form block fields"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Selecting the form block fields"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

Above the recently exposed form, add an image component. Give it the following JavaScript _URL_ binding:

```javascript JavaScript
let baseUrl = "https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03";
const rating = $("Repeater.film.rating");

if (rating === 'G') {
	return `${baseUrl}/general_audiences_badge.svg`;
}
else if (rating === 'PG') {
	return `${baseUrl}/parental_guidance_badge.svg`
}
else if (rating === 'PG-13') {
	return `${baseUrl}/parens_strongly_cautioned_badge.svg`

}
else if (rating === 'R') {
	return `${baseUrl}/restricted_badge.svg`
}

return `${baseUrl}/no_17_and_under_badge.svg`
```

As these images are white, you'll also want to edit the [Custom CSS](doc:custom-css) and give it a black background: `background-color: black;`. Also set a _width_ and _height_, e.g. 256px \* 96px.

![](https://files.readme.io/6757f5a-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_14.39.34.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/4773739-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_14.41.01.png)

### Displaying inventory count

Within the film view, it would also be useful to show the user what the current stock is for the selected film. 

In the **Data** section add another custom SQL query.

```sql
select COUNT(*) from inventory
WHERE film_id = {{ film_id }} and store_id = {{ store_id }}
GROUP BY film_id
```

![](https://files.readme.io/dfabd7a-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_14.50.30.png)

As always, be sure to `Run Query` and `Save Query`.

Back in the **Design** section, add a new Repeater block above the row explorer detail heading. Select the inventory count query as the datasource. Click the cog icon to pass in the binding values:

![](https://files.readme.io/d0185d5-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_15.02.53.png)

Nest the Heading component under the Stock Repeater block and give it the binding _Text_ value: `Stock: {{ Stock Repeater block.Get Inventory Count.count }}`.

![](https://files.readme.io/5aa907d-Screenshot_2023-02-09_at_15.56.40.png)
