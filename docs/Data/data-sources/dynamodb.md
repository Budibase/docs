DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

## Setup

To connect to DynamoDB you will need to know the **region** that your database is located.

In addition, you will need an **access key** and **secret key**. Both of these can be obtained by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SettingUp.DynamoWebService.html).

## Connect

Add a new datasource, and select DynamoDB.

You will be prompted to enter in the necessary credentials.

It is important to note that if you are hosting on *amazonaws.com* then your **region** field should match the region used in the **endpoint** field.

## Query types

The DynamoDB connector has a variety of query types beyond the typical CRUD options. 

| Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

More information on the client library used can be found [here](https://github.com/dabit3/dynamodb-documentclient-cheat-sheet).

DynamoDB query operations are further detailed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html).

## Create

To create an item, select the *Create* function, enter a table name, and provide an *Item* object with the appropriate table fields.

![](https://files.readme.io/9bbe739-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_17.15.04.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/7e15f7c-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_17.17.06.png)

If the primary key in your query matches an existing record, then Create will update that record. For example assuming the entry for 'Carol' has just been created, the following would perform an update:

```json
{
	"Item": {
		"id": "3",
		"Name": "Donna"
	}
}
```

![](https://files.readme.io/2061cf2-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_18.01.15.png)

Furthermore, any additional fields that are included within the *Item* payload will be added to your documents. 

## Scan

If you exclude the payload, then the scan query will simply return all rows of the specified table.

You can however provide a filter expression in the query box such as:

```json JSON
{
  "FilterExpression": "#studentName = :studentName",
  "ExpressionAttributeValues": { ":studentName": "Adam" },
  "ExpressionAttributeNames": { "#studentName": "Name" }
}
```

![](https://files.readme.io/0ded3d5-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_17.54.26.png)

## Get

This function will return a single item based on a primary key specified as follows:

```json
{
	"Key": {
		"id": "2"
	}
}
```

To return the item data, a minor change will be required in the [Transformer](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/transformers)

![](https://files.readme.io/109a215-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_18.11.24.png)

## Update

Similar to the *Get* function, *Update* requires a key and thus only updates one item at a time.

To perform an update, an update expression must also be provided. For example:

![](https://files.readme.io/ce3d071-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_18.27.15.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/7b15c2e-Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_18.27.42.png)

As you can see, you can also include [bindings](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/custom-queries#using-query-bindings) within your expressions. 

## Delete

To delete a single item, select the *Delete* function, and provide the primary key of the document within your query payload.

```json
{
	"Key": {
		"id": "1"
	}
}
```
