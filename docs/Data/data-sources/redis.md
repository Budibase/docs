Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine.

More information can be found in the [official Redis docs](https://redis.io/docs/about/).

This is the recommended function as it is the most flexible. The basic commands can be found below.

For more information on the range of Redis data types and commands, click [here](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/).

### Create

This is the equivalent of Redis' SET command. Enter a **key / string value** pair. 

**Ttl** stands for _Time-to-live_ and is the number of seconds that the data structure will exist. Leave this blank if you want your key/value to never expire.

Only **strings** are supported by this function. 

### Read

This is the equivalent of Redis' GET command. Simply enter a **key** you want to get. The response will return the mapped value.

### Delete

This is the equivalent of Redis' DEL command, except you can only delete a single **key** at a time.
