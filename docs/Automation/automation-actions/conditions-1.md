It is possible to perform an automation action only if certain trigger criteria are met.

For example, you may have a table of Orders as follows

[block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/1618162d1a89aa128e5d43b814919371be405dcbc4296831b3b5c28214f12ae9-Screenshot_2024-11-07_at_09.07.33.png","Screenshot 2022-05-04 at 12.34.49.png",null],"align":"center"}]}[/block]

and you want to send an [Email](doc:email) to notify the shopper of their purchase, but _only_ if the order is accepted.

## Steps

1. Create an automation using the **Row Updated** trigger.

2. Add a condition action.  
   The updated order must have had the _Accepted_ flag turned on to be able to continue.

        509
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Add the send email action.

      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
