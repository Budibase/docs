It is possible to see a list of automation runs for your published apps.  
To do so, click the `Settings` tab in the app builder.

This will take you to the app overview screen where you can click on the `Automations` tab to see a list of your automation runs.

      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}

You can filter and order the logs by automation name, data range, and status. 

There are three statuses:

- **Success**: The automation run was successful
- **Stopped**: The automation run was correctly terminated by a [Condition](doc:conditions-1)
- **Error**: The automation run failed to complete due to an error 
- **Stopped - Error**: Specific to [Cron jobs](doc:cronjob). If the cron automation errors five times back-to-back, it will be disabled until you re-publish your app.

## Investigating errors

Whenever an automation run errors, you will see a red banner at the top of your app list with the automation name and the number of times it failed in parentheses.

There is a convenient 'View error' link which will take you to the automation history, or you can click the 'X' to dismiss the notification.

        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}

When selecting an error, you will be able to see which automation step failed as well as the error output.

Furthermore, you can click the `Edit automation` button to be taken to the automation which may need fixed. 

> 📘 
> 
> Automation history will only show for published apps, and you must publish your app to apply any changes to your automations.

## Expiration 🔒

Logs are kept for a single day on the free plan, but you can expand the duration of time that logs are kept significantly by [upgrading](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/usage).

## Chain automations

On a per app basis, it is possible to toggle the _Enable chaining_ setting on/off. 

By default, this setting if **off** in cloud, and **on** in self-host.

When this setting is **on**, it allows any automation within the app that has any of the **Row** [Triggers](doc:trigger) (_Created, Updated, Deleted_) to be triggered when another automation fires a **Row** action (_Create, Update, Delete_).

Whether to have this setting on or off depends on your use-case:

- If you want to restrict your automations to only trigger upon <<glossary:End User>> table writes, then toggle **off**.
- If you want your automation row triggers to fire when an <<glossary:End User>> _OR_ an automation writes to a table, then toggle **on**. 

#### Example

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/298a7ec-Screenshot_2024-02-23_at_13.08.34.png",
        "",
        "An automation that creates a row in the 'Employee' table"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "An automation that creates a row in the 'Employee' table"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/7dd34b7-Screenshot_2024-02-23_at_13.10.00.png",
        "",
        "An automation that logs a message when an 'Employees' table row is created"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "An automation that logs a message when an 'Employees' table row is created"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


In this basic example, the first automation would only trigger then second if the _Enable chaining_ toggle was **on**.

> 📘 Additional info
> 
> As it could be possible to accidentally get into an infinite loop, the maximum number of automations that can be triggered in a sequence is **five**.
> 
> Also, chaining automation row events should not be confused with the [Trigger automation 🔒](doc:trigger-automation) action, which will always fire if used.
