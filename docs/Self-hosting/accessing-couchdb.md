Budibase uses CouchDB to store:

- Metadata about your apps and deployment
- Data stored when using Budibase's in-built tables
- Audit logs

You have full access to CouchDb, via [Fauxton](https://couchdb.apache.org/fauxton-visual-guide/index.html) - the official CouchDB client. You may access Fauxton via the URL: 

```
your-budibase-host/db/_utils/#
```



However, you will need a username and password to log in. You may find these in your **.env** file, which lives in the same directory as your **docker-compose.yaml**. 

Also make sure you are port forwarding to 5984.

Use the following values from your .env file: 

- COUCH_DB_USER
- COUCH_DB_PASSWORD
- COUCH_DB_PORT

### Example config

```yaml
couchdb-service:
    ports: 
      - "${COUCH_DB_PORT}:5984"
    environment:
      - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=${COUCH_DB_PASSWORD}
      - COUCHDB_USER=${COUCH_DB_USER}
      
```
