If you are running budibase in an environment where you need to use a proxy, such as inside an organisational network you can have budibase proxy all it's backend requests through a proxy of your choice. This functionality is driven by the `global-agent` package:

<https://github.com/gajus/global-agent>

### Configuration

There are 2 environment variables you will need to run budibase behind a company proxy:

| Variable                   | Purpose                                                                          | Required |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY`  | Where to proxy all server HTTP requests through                                  | Yes      |
| `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY` | Where to proxy all server HTTPS requests through                                 | No       |
| `GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY`    | A pattern of URLs that should be excluded from proxying. Eg. `*.foo.com,baz.com` | No       |

Bear in mind that these variables need to be made available to both the `worker` and `app` services, so if using docker compose, you must add them to your docker compose configuration:

```yaml YAML
services:
  app-service:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: budibase.docker.scarf.sh/budibase/apps
    container_name: bbapps
    environment:
     GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY: http://my-proxy.net
     GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY: https://my-proxy.net
  worker-service:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: budibase.docker.scarf.sh/budibase/apps
    container_name: bbworker
    environment:
      GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY: http://my-proxy.net
      GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY: https://my-proxy.net
```



For container to container communication using `docker-compose` - you may need to add the following to avoid that local communication going through your proxy:

`GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY: couchdb-service,app-service,worker-service,minio-service,redis-service,localhost`

For single image setups, you can pass these environment variables using standard `docker run` syntax.

```shell Bash
docker run -d -t 
-e GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY=http://my-proxy.net 
-p 10000:80 
-v /local/path/data:/data  
--restart unless-stopped 
budibase/budibase:latest
```

### Outbound Allow-list

To use your Budibase deployment, you must allow a list of outbound connections. These are as follows:

| URL                                                      | Purpose                                            |
