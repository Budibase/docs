# Example 2 - A Social Network

**Parts** of this type of application can be created with Budibase.

Characteristics:

- A private database per user - to store data specific to the user.
- A separate "social" engine, which manages data that is shared across all users
- Budibase Actions would be used to integrate Budibase with the Social Engine.

In this scenario, Budibase may be used to develop the user specific parts - i.e. the user's private data. 

The "Social Engine" cannot be handled by Budibase. This represents a large, shared service - used by all users. 

The entire frontend can still be built using Budibase.
