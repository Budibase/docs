# Application Package

This refers to a compressed bundle of files that represents a specific version of an application. The main files that it will contain are:

* Output from the Budibase builder \(database schema, frontend component definitions\)
* Third party code files, e.g. CSS and javascript
* Budibase client library
* Static files such as images
* Your custom code files, for your backend and frontend

These files are either served to the browser, to run client-side, or loaded into the Nodejs backend.
