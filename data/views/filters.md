# Filters

Filters are the vertical group of cells within your table. Another name for 'columns', is 'fields'. Columns organise your table's data into simple data types. A data type describes the structure and type of data required for columns. You can mark each column as required or not required. Columns marked as required must be completed when created a new row.
