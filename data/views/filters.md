# Filters

One of the core features of [views](./) is the ability to filter rows according to particular criteria. When a Row is filtered, it is not deletedâ€”it's just hidden from the particular View you're using and remains within the table \(Views are virtual tables!\).

Try adding filters when:

* You  need to focus on rows that meet certain conditions \(e.g. Classes between May and June, and taught by Albert Einstein\).
* You need to display certain information, to certain people \(e.g Each sales person can only view their own commission\).

## How to create a new Filter

To create a new Filter:

* [ ] Click the `create new row` button
* [ ] Add your data
* [ ] Click save

{% hint style="info" %}
Your table must have a column before you can create a table
{% endhint %}
