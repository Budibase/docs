# Options

The options data type stores options. When adding options, you must take a new line for each option. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: You might a table called Accounts and you want to know to assign a sales person to each new account. To do this, you would add a sales person column, and select the options data type. Once you have selected the options data type, you would then add the members of your sales team.
{% endhint %}
