# Date

The date data type stores dates. This is important when using components, or displaying information that relies on time/dates. A calendar component, for example, will utilize the date field. With Budibase, you can also provide a start date and end date, within your date data type. This allows you to add additional validation to the date column. The date's within Budibase comply to ISO8601 formating - `2020-09-24T13:12:04.622Z`. Thankfully, we have a date picker which removes the need to enter this form of date and makes life easier.

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: You might have a holiday home which you only want to let out between 4th May and 20th August. You would add the 4th May as your start date, and the 20th August as your end date. This stipulates only dates between the 4th May and 20th August can be added to that column. 
{% endhint %}
