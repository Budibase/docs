# Example - Fun With Flags

In this example, we will be creating a simple web application that will be used to store information about different countries around the world. Some of the information we are going to include in our application:
- Country Name
- Country Population
- Country Flag
- Travel Guide

## Creating Countries Table and Columns
Let's begin by creating a [table](../../tables/) to store data for our countries.

Next, we need to create [columns](../../tables/columns.md) in our `Countries` table. Let's look at the information we need to include about each country and decide which data types are the best to use for our columns.

**Country Name**: Country names are just letters, so a **Text** type is a good fit here.
**Country Population**: We should use a **Number** type for this.
**Country Flag**: This will require an image file - here is where **Attachment** types come in.
**Travel Guide**: We can store PDF travel guides for each country here. Let's use another **Attachment** type.

Watch the video below to find out how to set up your table as detailed above.

## Creating Rows and Uploading Data
Now that we have set up our columns, we can start to add some [rows](../../tables/rows.md) to our `Countries` table. You will now notice that on row creation, you will be presented with dropzone components inside the row creation popover for both of our attachment types - `Flag` and `Travel Guides`. 


Let's create an row for Spain. Follow along with the video below to find out how.

Here are the files used in the video below if you don't have your own:
