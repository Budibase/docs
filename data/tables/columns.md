# Columns

Columns are the vertical group of cells within your table. Another name for 'columns', is 'fields'. Columns organise your table's data into simple data types. A data type describes the structure and type of data required for columns. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, a 'Phone Number' Column, will use the 'Number' type.
{% endhint %}

## Data types

### **Text**

The text data type stores text, including numbers.  A text column is a good choice if you want to store data like names, addresses, or simple custom data.



### **Number**

The number data type stores numbers.  A number column is a good choice if you want to store data like age, phone numbers, values. It's important to note, the number column type is important when you need to do calculations within your data. Within the Number data type, you can provide min and max values. This allows you to add additional validation to your data type. For example, you might have a scoring system in place. The scoring system is from 0 \(min\) to 10 \(max\). This stipulates only numbers between 0 and 10 can be added to that column.

### **Yes/No** 

The Yes/No is a data type that has one of two possible values \(usually denoted as true/false, yes/no, Boolean\). Within your UI, this is usually displayed in the form of a checkbox.

### **Attachment**

Within your Budibase table, you can store images and documents, using the attachment data type.

### **Date**

The date data type stores dates. This is important when using components, or displaying information which relies on time. A calendar component, for example, will utilise the date field. Which Budibase, you can also provide a start date and end data, within your date data type. This allows you to additional validation to the date column. For example, you might have a holiday home which you only want to let out between 4th May and 20th August. You would add the 4th May as your start date, and the 20th August as your end date. This stipulates only dates between the 4th May and 20th August can be added to that column.
